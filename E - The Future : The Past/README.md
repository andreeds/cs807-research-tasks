## Synopsis

This project is theoretical research abouth quantum computers called **Beyond Quantum Computing:
Are we living in a simulation?**.

For more details, read the abstract below.

## Abstract

>When the future of computer comes to discussion, quantum computers is a salient topic.
>Quantum computer uses the properties of quantum mechanical states to solve certain specific problems much faster than we know how to solve them using a conventional computer.
>Thus, in the future humans will be able to simulate all sort of quantum chemistry and atomic physics efficiently, that means, humanity will have reached the "posthuman" stage.
>
>If quantum computers will simulate even billions of very distant stars, it could simulate the civilizations too.
>If the concept of consciousness can be applied to computers, then simulating brains, and furthermore civilizations, is not so hard to believe. 
>Therefore, in the posthuman stage we may want to simulate our ancestors
>So, is it possible that we are living in a computer simulation?
In this paper we show that it can be true.


## Motivation

This project is one research task of the class *CS 807: Interactive Hardware and Embedded Computing*.

 

This task in particular is called **The Future / The Past**, which requires to research and present a paper or topic relating to post-silicon, post-moore advanced computing platforms such as quantum computing, biocomputing (including wet neural computing and molecular computing), exotic materials such as graphene or nan- otubes and devices such as memristors, etc. 
Alternatively, it must contain the research and present on a topic related to pre-silicon computing, such as vacuum tubes, punched-cards, non-electrical comput- ing, water gates, the antikythera mechanism, analytical engine, etc. 
The primary references for this task doesnt have to be an academic paper.
