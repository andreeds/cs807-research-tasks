## Synopsis

This project is a theoretical research abouth with a critique of the paper **A Differential Approach to Inference in Bayesian Networks**, from [Darwiche](http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3847).

For more details, read the abstract below.

## Abstract

> Bayesian networks (BNs) is a probabilistic graphical model for dealing with uncertainty in artificial intelligence. 
> However, BNs are known for requiring a high amount of processing during its running time of execution. 
> This strongly limits the applications of BNs to embedded systems, which are characterized for their primitive computational resources. 
> Darwiche (2000) proposes a new approach for inference in Bayesian networks based on partial differentiation. 
> Once the BN is processed, one can compute in constant-time answers to a large class of probabilistic queries. 
> One of the key contributions is the possible cost- effective implementation on a variety of software and hardware platforms.

> The paper has a mathematical heavy notation and it is not a easy reading. 
> A reason is the weak background on probabilistic graphical models. 
> Thus, it is not self contained, which means one might have to look for second sources. 
> Throughout the paper, several advantages are presented All claims have proof and are sound. 
> However, some points are not discussed in the paper, such the generalization of the proposed approach for other networks.


## Motivation

This project is one research task of the class *CS 807: Interactive Hardware and Embedded Computing*.

 

This task in particular is called **The Paper**, which requires to find, study, and write a summary and critique of a recent (past 5 years) theoretical academic paper on a constrained computing topic of your choice, and present it to the class. Focus on the subject areas of embedded, cloud, low power, or high-performance computing. You may need to follow up on references from the paper to fully understand some topics.
