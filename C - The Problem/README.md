## Abstract

>Arithmetic Circuits (AC) is a graphical method for reasoning with Bayesian networks (BNs) based on partial differentiation. ACs is a viable framework for applications of BNs to embedded systems, which are characterized for their primitive computational resources. An AC is a directed acyclic graph with four types of variables: evidence indicators, network parameters (probability values), sum nodes and product nodes. There are two phases to compile the AC: upward and inward. Those phases pass messages through the AC, which are essentially numbers. The number of messages passed in both phases is twice the number of edges in the compilation of the polynomial. Once the BN is processed, one can compute in constant-time answers to a large class of probabilistic queries. In this paper we present the algorithm to compile the AC. We show how a parallel solution and describe how it compares to a serial solution.


## Motivation

This project is one research task of the class *CS 807: Interactive Hardware and Embedded Computing*.

 
This task in particular is called **The problem**, which requires to find a problem of interest within your area of study, and do some research to determine if a parallel solution exists. Then, describe how it compares to a serial solution.
